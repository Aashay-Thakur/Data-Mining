Use the datasets "mushroom.training" and "mushroom.test" as is.


Make sure you haven't edited the whitespace between the columns (This could break the program)
If you have, copy the whitespace from somewhere else in the file as is, and replace the one you edited.

Place the datasets into a folder "/data" in the same directory as the python file.
Your filestructure will be somthing like this.

|-- naive_bayes.py
|-- readme.txt
|-- data
    |-- mushroom.training
    |-- mushroom.test

Ensure that the files are converted into their respactive ".csv" formats.
Make sure there are no repeating commas.
